    Firebase state (state.firebase) (optional, default `'store'`)

**Examples**

_Basic_

```javascript
// this.props.firebase set on App component as firebase object with helpers
import { createFirestoreConnect } from 'react-redux-firebase'
// create firebase connect that uses another redux store
const firestoreConnect = createFirestoreConnect('anotherStore')
// use the firebaseConnect to wrap a component
export default firestoreConnect()(SomeComponent)
```

Returns **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** HOC that accepts a watchArray and wraps a component

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { firestoreConnect } from 'react-redux-firebase'

export default compose(
  firestoreConnect(['todos']), // sync todos collection from Firestore into redux
  connect((state) => ({
    todosList: state.firestore.data.todos,
