    Firebase state (`state.firebase`) (optional, default `'store'`)

**Examples**

_Basic_

```javascript
// this.props.firebase set on App component as firebase object with helpers
import { createWithFirebase } from 'react-redux-firebase'

// create withFirebase that uses another redux store
const withFirebase = createWithFirebase('anotherStore')

// use the withFirebase to wrap a component
export default withFirebase(SomeComponent)
```

watchers config and wraps a React Component

## withFirebase

**Extends React.Component**

and functionality which give it it's capabilities such as dispatching
actions.

```javascript
import { withFirebase } from 'react-redux-firebase'

const AddData = ({ firebase: { push } }) =>
  <div>
    <button onClick={() => push('todos', { done: false, text: 'Sample' })}>
      Add Sample Todo
    </button>
  </div>

export default withFirebase(AddData)
```

```javascript
import { compose } from 'redux' // can also come from recompose
import { withHandlers } from 'recompose'
import { withFirebase } from 'react-redux-firebase'

const AddTodo = ({ addTodo }) =>
  <div>
    <button onClick={addTodo}>
      Add Sample Todo
    </button>
  </div>

export default compose(
  withFirebase(AddTodo),
  withHandlers({
    addTodo: props => () =>
       props.firestore.add(
         { collection: 'todos' },
         { done: false, text: 'Sample' }
