This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), the docs for that are in the Create React App Docs section below

## React Redux Firebase Docs

### Run With Example Data

1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
1. Run `yarn start`
1. Visit `localhost:3000` to view and add todos (note the todos are shared among everyone)

### Run Your Own

1. Make sure you have Firestore setup within your Firebase console - data will be added/loaded from the `todos` collection
1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
1. Change the config in `src/config/config.js` to match your Firebase instance (from Firebase console)
1. Run `yarn start`
1. Visit `localhost:3000` to view and add todos to your own `todos` collection of Firestore

### FAQ

1. Where is data being loaded from?:
    The `todos` collection within firestore

1. What is the format of a todo created in this example? :
    `{ text: 'sample', done: false }`

  New todos can be created from the home screen

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
